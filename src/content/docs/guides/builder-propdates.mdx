title: How to Post a Propdate
---

## Overview

In addition to creating milestone-based escrow proposals and requesting the release of milestones, users and DAO members can now **post updates**, so‑called *Propdates*, directly within the proposal feed. These updates use the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://docs.attest.org/) to record comments and updates on-chain in a secure and verifiable way. A brief demo of the functionality can be found [here](https://www.loom.com/share/d1a42ab110b94c7e8df8ec6452dd3669?sid=b4b5399f-f706-4b1a-8b80-097cab658769).

Users can access the Propdate functionality by navigating to the DAO’s `Activity` section, selecting a proposal, and scrolling down.

## Viewing Propdate

Propdates and comments by DAO members are shown by default, but non-member updates can be viewed by selecting `All Propdates`.

## How It Works

Each update or release request is stored as an **on-chain attestation** using EAS, read more at the [Attestations Reference](../reference/attestations.mdx). Propdates you post will appear in the **"Propdates"** feed under the proposal.

By selecting `Post Propdate` users and DAO members can comment on proposals before, during, and after voting ended to:

- Add public updates
- Track progress across milestones
- Reply to comments and updates

## Submitting an Update

1. Open the **Proposal Page**.
2. Click `Create Propdate` under the Propdates section.
3. Type your message.
4. Click `Post Propdate` and sign the transaction in your wallet.
5. Wait for the propdate to be posted on chain.

Alternatively, you can also respond to Propdates by using the `Reply` functionality.

Using Propdates will create an EAS attestation on-chain that is tied to the selected proposal, and your wallet address or ENS will be associated with the content.
