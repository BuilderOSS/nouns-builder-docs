title: Changing and Adding Artwork
---

This guide covers the proposal types for modifying artwork in your Nouns Builder DAO: **Replace Artwork** (also known as Change Artwork) and **Add Artwork**. These features allow DAOs to update or expand their generative NFT artwork. Note that all changes require a proposal to be created, voted on, and executed on-chain.

Artwork in Nouns Builder is structured in layers (traits or properties), with each layer containing multiple variants (items). The system uses IPFS for storage and an on-chain metadata renderer to compose NFTs generatively.

## Overview

- **Layers (Traits/Properties)**: Up to 15 maximum, e.g., background, body, accessories
- **Variants (Items)**: No hard contract limit per layer, but practical limits apply due to upload constraints.
- **Process**: Changes are additive and immutable on IPFS. You cannot delete existing artwork; replacements or additions are the only options.
- **Proposal Flow**: Use the proposal creation interface on nouns.build. Upload folders must follow a specific structure (e.g., numbered folders for layers, with variants inside).

Refer to the [Configuring the NFT's Images guide](/guides/img-config) to learn how to set up your NFT artwork.

## Replace Artwork Proposal

This proposal type replaces the entire artwork set for your DAO. It is ideal for major overhauls, such as changing file types, dimensions, or replacing multiple variants.

### Steps
1. Navigate to your DAO on nouns.build and select "Create Proposal".
2. Choose the "Replace Artwork" template.
3. Upload your artwork folder:
   - Structure: Organize into subfolders (e.g., `0-background/`, `1-body/`) containing variant files.
   - File type: All files in the replacement set must share a single type (PNG, SVG, or GIF). You may change the collection’s overall type in a Replace Artwork proposal, but mixing types within the same set is not supported.
   - Ensure the total directory size is under 200 MB.
4. Validate the upload: The interface will check layer ordering and variant counts.
5. Submit the proposal for voting and execution.

### Use Cases
- Overhauling the entire collection, e.g., replacing **ALL** existing art, or switching file types.
- Replacing a single variant (requires re-uploading all artwork with the change).
- Adjusting dimensions or file types across the board.

### Limitations
- You must re-upload the entire artwork set; selective changes are not supported.
- Existing tokens may render updated assets if your renderer retrieves files on-chain rather than using cached snapshots. Test your renderer’s behavior on staging before proposing changes.
- To “remove” a variant, replace it with a transparent file; note this can cause visual issues for already-minted NFTs when that variant is rendered.
- File type: all files in a single Replace Artwork proposal must share one format. You may switch the collection’s overall file type by replacing the entire set, but do not mix formats within one proposal.
## Add Artwork Proposal

This proposal type adds new variants to existing layers or introduces entirely new layers. It is additive and does not replace the full set.

### Steps
1. Navigate to your DAO on nouns.build and select "Create Proposal".
2. Choose the "Add Artwork" template.
3. Upload your new artwork folder:
   - Structure: Use subfolders matching existing layer names to add variants (e.g., `background/` for new backgrounds).
   - To add a new layer, use a new folder name (e.g., `hats/`).
   - Folders with the same name as existing layers will append variants.
4. Validate the upload: Ensure compatibility with existing artwork (e.g., same file type and dimensions).
5. Submit the proposal for voting and execution.

### Use Cases
- Expanding a layer with new variants (e.g., changing a backgrounds).
- Introducing a new layer (e.g., adding "hats" to an existing collection).
- Adding multiple variants across different layers in one proposal.
- Introducing a new file type for individual traits, such as a GIF property

### Limitations
- Cannot delete or replace existing variants; additions only.
- Dimensions must match existing artwork.
- Layer ordering: New layers are appended; ensure correct sequencing in the upload.
- If adding to multiple layers, include each layer as its own folder in one upload batch. Avoid duplicate filenames within a layer; uploader behavior may overwrite or fail—do not rely on it.
- Large additions (e.g., >500 variants per layer) may hit transaction/upload limits; test on staging.

## General Limitations

- **Maximum Layers**: 15 (hard contract limit).
- **Variants per Layer**: No contract limit, but recommended up to 150–200 total files across all layers to avoid upload issues. Tested up to ~250 variants per layer.
- **File Count and Size**: 
  - Total directory: Up to 200 MB.
  - Individual media files: Up to 50 MB.
  - File limit: As of August 2025, the v3 Pinata API reliably handles ~150 files per batch in our flows. We are temporarily using the legacy API to improve stability; this may change—check release notes before large uploads.
- **Immutability**: Once uploaded to IPFS, content cannot be deleted. Use transparent files for "removals," but test thoroughly.
- **Generative Nature**: Changes affect future NFTs only; verify via previews or test DAOs.
- **Testing**: Always test (**extensively!**) on testnets first (testnet.nouns.build) before mainnet proposals.
- **Complex Scenarios**: Adding GIFs or mixing types requires replacing all artwork. Untested for varying GIF durations or frame rates.

:::caution

The upload of GIF file types is currently only available on staging as **PROTOTYPICAL** implementation. Please proceed with caution, as this feature is not yet cleared for production and **ACTIVELY** worked on.

## Supported File Types

Collections can have multiple file types across all layers, but any transaction to change or add artwork can only contain a single file type (PNG, SVG, or GIF).
- **PNG**: Standard for static layers.
- **SVG**: Vector-based; supported for scalability.
- **GIF**: Animated; **PROTOTYPICAL IMPLEMENTATION—staging only**. If using GIFs, the entire replacement set must be GIF (convert static layers to single‑frame GIFs as needed).
