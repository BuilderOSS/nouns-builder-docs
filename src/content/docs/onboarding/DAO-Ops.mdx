---


Builder DAOs thrive on active coordination, transparent execution, and engaged community participation. This section covers the core operational tools and workflows needed to run your DAO smoothly‚Äîfrom daily tasks to analytics and off-chain collaboration.

## üõ†Ô∏è Daily Operations

### Moderation, Bot Management, and Announcement Workflows

Keeping your DAO organized and safe begins with clear communication and consistent moderation.

**Moderation tasks:**

- Maintain Discord and Warpcast channels for civil, on-topic discussion.
- Assign roles (e.g. voter, contributor, core team) with specific permissions.
- Enforce community guidelines and escalate disputes if needed.

**Bot management:**

- Use bots like **Gnosis Safe Notifier**, **DAO Activity Pings**, or **Builder Voting Alerts** to automate proposal and auction updates.
- Integrate **Propdate** or **Warpcast Bots** for governance notifications.

**Announcements:**

- Pin important updates in Discord or Warpcast.
- Use recurring governance digests to summarize activity and drive participation.

### Handling Auctions, Votes, and Proposals

Most Builder DAOs run a 24-hour auction cycle for minting new governance tokens. Here's how to manage and monitor auction-related governance tasks:

**Auctions**

- Track auction start/end times on [nouns.build](https://nouns.build/).
- Share current auction links and encourage bidding.
- Announce winners and welcome new token holders.

**Votes & Proposals**

- Guide members through the proposal lifecycle: draft ‚Üí discussion ‚Üí onchain submission ‚Üí vote ‚Üí execution.
- Use templates to standardize proposals and help contributors stay consistent.

## üßæ Multisig Management

### Setting Up Gnosis Safe and Transaction Workflows

For offchain assets (like USDC or grants), use a **Gnosis Safe** multisig to hold and manage funds securely.

**Setup steps:**

1. Go to [gnosis-safe.io](https://gnosis-safe.io/) and create a new safe.
2. Add DAO signers (e.g. 3-of-5 core contributors).
3. Fund the safe with treasury tokens or ETH.
4. Create and execute transactions with signer approval.

**Best practices:**

- Rotate signers if roles change.
- Keep the Safe address public and verifiable in DAO docs.

### Using Zodiac or Third-Party Tools for Off-Chain Voting

Builder DAOs can extend governance via **Zodiac**, allowing offchain decisions to be executed onchain via Gnosis Safe modules.

**Use Cases:**

- Approve proposals via Snapshot and execute via Zodiac.
- Allow subcommittees or working groups to manage smaller budgets.

**Other tools:**

- **SafeSnap** ‚Äì Snapshot voting that triggers onchain actions via Gnosis Safe.
- **Coordinape** or **Clarity** ‚Äì For contributor compensation and voting-based allocations.

## üìä Analytics & Reporting

### Suggested KPIs for DAO Health

Tracking the right metrics helps you understand what‚Äôs working and where support is needed.

**Key DAO health indicators:**

- Proposal submission rate
- Proposal pass/fail ratio
- Voting participation (active wallets / total supply)
- Treasury inflows/outflows
- Auction revenue per cycle
- Community growth (Discord, Warpcast, email, etc.)

Track these monthly to maintain transparency and inform strategy.
