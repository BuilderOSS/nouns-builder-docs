## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 DAO Participation

### “How do I join a DAO?”

To join a Builder DAO, you typically acquire one of its governance tokens. These are distributed through auctions or can sometimes be purchased on secondary markets (e.g., OpenSea or Zora).

**Ways to join:**

1. **Participate in a live token auction** on [nouns.build](https://nouns.build/).
2. **Buy a token** from a previous winner via a marketplace.
3. **Engage without owning a token** by contributing to discussions, helping with proposals, or participating in grants and bounties.

Ownership isn't required to be part of the community—many DAOs welcome contributors of all kinds.

### “What happens if I win an auction?”

If you win a DAO auction:

- You receive a **governance token** (usually an NFT) minted directly to your wallet.
- You **gain the ability to vote** on proposals and shape the future of the DAO.
- You become part of the DAO’s **onchain record of contributors**.

Your funds (ETH) go directly to the DAO treasury to support community initiatives.

## 🗳️ Governance Questions

### “Why did my proposal fail?”

There are a few common reasons a proposal might fail:

- **Didn’t reach quorum**: Not enough voting power participated.
- **Insufficient votes in favor**: More tokens voted against than for.
- **Invalid execution logic**: Proposal included incorrect or broken contract calls.
- **Poor communication**: The community didn’t understand or support the idea.

**Pro tip**: Share proposals early in Discord or Warpcast to gather support and feedback before submitting onchain.

### “How do I delegate my vote?”

Delegation allows you to assign your voting power to another wallet (often a trusted contributor or “Nouncillor”).

**To delegate:**

1. Visit the DAO’s voting interface (e.g., Tally or Builder Voting).
2. Navigate to the **Delegation** section.
3. Enter the wallet address of the person you want to delegate to.
4. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

You can undelegate or change your delegate at any time.

## 🧰 Technical Questions

### “Can I use my own frontend?”

Yes! The Builder Protocol is fully open-source and modular, meaning you can fork the [frontend codebase](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-builder) and deploy a custom UI for your DAO.

**Reasons to use a custom frontend:**

- Tailored branding or user experience
- Added features (e.g., analytics, contributor tools)
- Native integrations with your project’s ecosystem

**Steps:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure it with your DAO’s contract addresses.
3. Customize visuals and components.
4. Deploy to your own domain.

### “Where can I find verified contracts?”

All Builder DAO contracts are deployed onchain and most are verified on block explorers like **Etherscan**, **Basescan**, or **Optimism Explorer**.

**To find your DAO’s contracts:**

1. Go to your DAO’s profile on [nouns.build](https://nouns.build/).
2. Scroll to the DAO Settings or Auction Details section.
3. Click the contract address links to view on the block explorer.
4. Use the **“Contract”** and **“Read/Write”** tabs to interact or inspect.
