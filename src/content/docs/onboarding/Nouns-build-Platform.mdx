title: The Nouns.build Platform
---

The [nouns.build](http://nouns.build/) platform is the primary frontend interface for launching, discovering, and managing Builder DAOs. It abstracts complex smart contract interactions into a clean and user-friendly experience, allowing individuals and communities to create and participate in DAOs without needing to write code.

---

## Platform Overview

### What It Does

The platform serves as:

- A **DAO launcher**: Create a fully onchain DAO in minutes.
- A **management dashboard**: Interact with proposals, token auctions, and treasury funds.
- A **discovery tool**: Browse and learn from other DAOs in the ecosystem.

Everything that happens through the platform is executed onchain, making governance actions transparent and verifiable.

---

### Hosted vs. Self-Hosted Options

There are two ways to interact with the protocol:

### 1. **Hosted (via nouns.build)**

- **Fast and convenient**: No deployment or server required.
- **Managed frontend**: All the logic is handled for you.
- **Recommended for most users**: Ideal for creators and communities launching their first DAO.

### 2. **Self-Hosted**

- **Customizable**: Modify branding, layout, or logic.
- **Requires development skills**: You’ll need to fork the [open-source code](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-builder) and deploy it yourself.
- **Ideal for advanced teams**: Great for DAOs with specific design or integration needs.

## DAO Discovery & Profiles

### How DAOs Appear and Are Categorized

DAOs launched through the platform are publicly visible on the homepage and DAO index. They are typically sorted by:

- **Launch date**
- **Auction activity**
- **Proposal volume**
- **Treasury size**

This allows users to explore and compare different DAOs across the Builder ecosystem.

---

### Profile Customization and Visibility

Each DAO has its own profile page, featuring:

- Token auctions
- Proposal activity
- Treasury overview
- Governance settings

DAOs can customize:

- **Name and description**
- **Banner image**
- **Token artwork or visual logic (NFTs or static art)**

These profiles act as a landing page for new members and voters.

## Feature Guide

### Launch Flow Walkthrough

Launching a DAO on nouns.build takes only a few steps:

1. **Click “Launch a DAO”**
2. **Enter basic details**: Name, symbol, auction settings, governance rules
3. **Customize visuals**: Upload artwork or configure token rendering logic
4. **Deploy**: Confirm the transaction in your wallet to launch

Once deployed, your DAO will begin auctioning its first token and be publicly visible on the site.


---

### Proposal Management UI

The proposal interface makes it easy to:

- Draft and submit proposals
- View voting timelines and quorum status
- Cast onchain votes directly through your wallet
- Track executed proposals

Each proposal page includes a live status indicator and transaction history for transparency.

### Auction Dashboard and Analytics

Every DAO has a real-time auction dashboard where you can:

- View current and past auctions
- Place bids
- See top bidders
- Track token issuance history

Some DAOs integrate analytics dashboards (e.g., Dune) to visualize treasury growth, proposal metrics, and community engagement.

## Limitations & FAQs

### Known Issues and Feature Roadmap

The nouns.build platform is rapidly evolving, but some current limitations include:

- No built-in multisig or offchain voting options (requires integration)
- Limited support for DAO-to-DAO relationships or delegation
- Proposal templates are basic (no advanced formatting or attachments)

Upcoming roadmap features may include:

- Delegation and voting enhancements
- Easier token art customization tools

#### Confirmed Roadmap

- **July 2025**:
  - Finalise SDK, including utils and hooks ([#574](https://github.com/BuilderOSS/nouns-builder/issues/574), [#575](https://github.com/BuilderOSS/nouns-builder/issues/575))
- **August 2025**:
  - Add "User votes", "User proposals", and voting history to a new "Activity" tab on profile page ([#318](https://github.com/BuilderOSS/nouns-builder/issues/318))
- **August–September 2025**:
  - Enable payment streaming through proposals (e.g. Sablier, Superfluid) ([#463](https://github.com/BuilderOSS/nouns-builder/issues/463))
- **TBD**:
  - Community-led Nouns Site template ([Noun Site repo](https://github.com/BuilderOSS/noun-site))

:::tip
**Community Product Prioritisation Sessions** are held at least every two months, where you can advocate for your favourit feature to make it onto the short-term roadmap.

### What Requires Direct Smart Contract Interaction

While most actions can be done via the UI, some advanced tasks may require interacting directly with smart contracts:

- Upgrading governance logic
- Adding custom proposal logic/hooks
- Migrating treasury assets across protocols
- Advanced rendering configuration

Developers can use tools like Etherscan, Hardhat, or the Builder SDK for deeper control.
