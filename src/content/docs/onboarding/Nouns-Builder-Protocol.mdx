The Nouns Builder Protocol is an open-source smart contract system that allows anyone to launch a fully onchain DAO with programmable governance, automated token issuance, and treasury management. This section breaks down how the protocol works, its architecture, and how to interact with it.

## How It Works

### Token Auction Mechanisms

At the heart of every Builder DAO is a recurring token auction system. Instead of launching all governance tokens at once, new tokens are auctioned one at a time on a fixed schedule.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Auction Interval:** Each DAO configures how often a new token is auctioned (e.g., every 24 hours).
- **Bidding Process:** Participants bid using ETH, and the highest bidder wins the token. A new high bid within the last 5 minutes of the auction will extend the auction duration for another 5 minutes. This will continue until the auction goes 5 minutes without a new high bid and the auction closes.
- **Token Minting:** Settling an auction distributes the last token to the winner, mints the next token, and kicks off a new 24 hour auction.

This approach ensures fair distribution over time and creates a predictable funding stream for the DAO treasury.

### Governance Parameters

Builder DAOs use onchain governance to make decisions. The protocol provides customizable governance settings when launching a DAO:

- **Voting Delay:** Time between when a proposal is submitted and when voting begins.
- **Voting Period:** Duration the community has to vote on a proposal.
- **Quorum Threshold:** Minimum number of votes needed for a proposal to be valid.
- **Proposal Threshold:** Minimum number of tokens required to create a proposal.

These parameters shape how responsive, secure, and participatory your DAO will be.

### Treasury Management

Funds from each token auction are automatically routed to the DAO's treasury, which is controlled by governance.

- **No central ownership:** The treasury is owned and managed by the DAO itself.
- **Proposal-controlled spending:** Members propose and vote on how funds are used.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are recorded onchain and visible to the public.

DAOs often use these funds for grants, contributor payments, community tools, or protocol improvements.

## Contract Architecture

### Key Smart Contracts and Their Roles

The Nouns Builder Protocol consists of several modular smart contracts. These include:

- **Auction Contract:** Manages the auction logic and token minting.
- **Token Contract (ERC-721 or ERC-20):** Represents ownership and governance power.
- **Governor Contract:** Handles proposal creation, voting, and execution.
- **Metadata/Render Contract:** Controls visual and metadata logic for NFTs (if using NFTs).
- **Treasury Contract:** Stores and secures the DAO's funds.

Each component is interoperable and can be extended or customized by developers.

---

### Upgradeability and Modularity

The protocol is designed with flexibility in mind:

- **Upgradeable Governance Contracts:** Using the OpenZeppelin upgrade pattern, governance logic can evolve over time.
- **Modular Design:** DAOs can replace or extend individual components (e.g., custom token logic or auction formats).
- **Parameter Tuning:** Governance can change auction intervals, governance rules, and more post-launch.

This makes the protocol suitable for both simple and highly customized DAO setups.

### Security Model

Security is paramount for onchain governance systems. Key features include:

- **Immutable Treasury Ownership:** Only proposals passed by token holders can move treasury funds.
- **Audit History:** The protocol builds on audited components from Nouns and OpenZeppelin.
- **Permissionless Deployments:** Anyone can deploy without relying on a central admin.

DAOs should still conduct additional audits if they customize or extend the system.

## Interacting with the Protocol

### Frontend Options

The easiest way to interact with the protocol is through the [nouns.build](http://nouns.build/) web interface.

From the dashboard, you can:

- Launch a DAO
- View and bid on auctions
- Submit and vote on proposals
- Monitor treasury and DAO activity

### Using the Builder SDK and API

For developers, the [Builder SDK](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-builder) offers tools to build and interact with DAOs programmatically.

**Features:**

- Fetch auction data and governance states
- Submit transactions via script
- Integrate DAO data into custom apps

**Example Use Cases:**

- Custom frontend for your DAO
- Proposal automation tools
- Onchain analytics dashboards

---

### CLI Tools and Third-Party Integrations

In addition to the SDK, you can use command-line tools and third-party platforms:

- **Hardhat/Foundry**: For deploying and testing DAO contracts
- **Tally.xyz**: Some DAOs integrate with external governance dashboards
- **Dune Analytics**: Track DAO performance using community dashboards
- **Gnosis Safe & Zodiac**: Extend DAO control with multisig integrations
