### Lessons Learned

From these DAOs, we can observe several patterns:

- **Clarity of purpose leads to engagement**: DAOs with strong missions (e.g. supporting Farcaster, esports, local communities) attract more aligned contributors.
- **Flexible tooling supports growth**: Builder DAOs can evolve from small experiments to full-scale communities.
- **Onchain transparency builds trust**: Voters can always verify where funds go and who is participating.

## üõ†Ô∏è Customizing Your DAO

### Changing Parameters

Builder DAOs are initialized with governance and auction parameters, but most of these can be changed via proposal after launch:

- **Auction duration**
- **Quorum threshold**
- **Voting delay/period**
- **Proposal threshold**

**How to update parameters:**

1. Draft a proposal using the DAO‚Äôs frontend or SDK
2. Specify new parameter values as onchain calls
3. Submit and pass the proposal

### Upgrading Visual Identity (Art, Metadata)

Builder Protocol allows full customization of how your DAO's tokens look and behave:

**Options include:**

- **Static Images**: Upload your own artwork or logo
- **Dynamic Metadata**: Use generative art or trait-based logic (common in NFT communities)
- **Metadata Renderer Upgrades**: Deploy a new renderer and update via proposal

**Tips for strong visual identity:**

- Align artwork with your DAO‚Äôs mission or vibe
- Use color and iconography that‚Äôs recognizable across platforms
- Collaborate with artists in your community


---

## üîå Ecosystem Integrations

### POAPs (Proof of Attendance Protocol)

Builder DAOs can use POAPs to reward participation at events or governance milestones. For example:

- Give a POAP to voters in a key proposal
- Distribute POAPs during IRL meetups or community calls

POAPs help gamify participation and foster collector culture within your DAO.

---

### Farcaster

Builder DAOs frequently coordinate on [Farcaster](https://www.farcaster.xyz/), the decentralized social network. You can:

- Create a DAO-specific channel
- Post governance updates, auction links, and discussions
- Use reactions and replies for informal signaling

Some DAOs even delegate voting power based on Farcaster reputation or activity.

---

### Onchain Art and NFTs

Many Builder DAOs use onchain art to:

- Embed metadata traits into token auctions
- Incentivize participation with art-based drops
- Collaborate with artists for limited edition series

You can deploy custom metadata renderers, use `tokenURI` hooks, or collaborate with generative artists to create new experiences.
