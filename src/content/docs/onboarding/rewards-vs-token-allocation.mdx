#### Understanding the difference between Reward Splits vs. Token Allocations

When deploying a DAO with Nouns Builder, there are two distinct settings that govern how funds and tokens are distributed. These are often confused but are technically and operationally separate.

This guide explains the key differences between **protocol-level auction reward splits** and **configurable token allocations**, and provides instructions for withdrawing funds from the Rewards contract.

---

## 1. Auction Rewards (Protocol-Level Split)

When a DAO is deployed, a fixed portion of auction proceeds is routed to a designated **Rewards Recipient**. This address is set at deployment and **cannot be changed later**. It is part of the protocol logic.

These rewards accumulate in the Builder Protocol Rewards contract and must be claimed manually.

### Claiming Protocol Rewards

To withdraw funds:

1. Go to the [Rewards Contract on BaseScan](https://basescan.org/address/0x7777777F279eba3d3Ad8F4E708545291A6fDBA8B#writeContract)
2. Connect your wallet via "Connect to Web3"
3. Navigate to the `Write Contract` tab
4. Use function `#5 withdrawFor(address recipient, uint256 amount)`
5. For `recipient`, input the DAO’s reward address (typically your treasury or multisig)  
   - **Example only:** `0x894F30da29216516b5aE85207dED77038C107f22` (used by nouns.build — do not use this for your DAO)
6. For `amount`, input `0` — this will sweep the full balance owed.

:::tip[Note:]
This interface and documentation will be integrated into the app UI (see [#513](https://github.com/BuilderOSS/nouns-builder/issues/513)) and [deployment guide](https://builder-docs.vercel.app/guides/builder-deployment/#allocations) will be updated accordingly.

## 2. Token Allocations (Configurable)

Token Allocations allow a DAO to automatically allocate a percentage of newly minted NFTs to one or more addresses. This setting **can be configured or updated via the Admin tab** in the app UI.

These allocations are not related to the ETH collected from auctions. Instead, they govern who receives minted NFTs and in what proportion.

### Common Use Cases

- Allocating tokens to contributors
- Reserving a percentage for community treasury
- Routing mints to sub-DAOs or partnerships
