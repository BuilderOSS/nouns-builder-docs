title: Nouns Builder Ecosystem Tooling
---

## Objective

This page provides an overview of the key tooling that supports the Nouns Builder protocol and application ecosystem.

As of Q2 2025, a number of repositories and services originally maintained by Zora are being transferred to Nouns Builder DAO. This transition has surfaced outdated code, duplicated components, and tools that no longer reflect DAO needs.

To support current and future technical residents, this report documents the state of each major tool, outlines necessary actions, and clarifies which systems are deprecated, in use, or require upgrades.

The table below is a working index of this ecosystem. It is intended to support coordination between contributors, guide future RFPs, and improve visibility across the Builder stack.

We encourage contributors to review the tooling listed here before proposing fixes, integrations, or new features.

## Tooling Overview

An overview of the existing tooling also containes the column ‚ÄúCall-to-action‚Äù, which provides the evaluation by the Tech Residents and outlines tangible steps that MAY be taken by current or future tech residents. In the status column we give an assessment of the future viability of the tooling. The colour codes are defined as follows:

üü© ‚Äî the tool is up-to-date or updates are planned. Support in the future is certain.  
üü®  ‚Äî the tool is outdated and must be updated. Future support must be agreed upon by the community.  
üü• ‚Äî the tool is outdated and updates are unfeasible. The tool will not be supported in the future.
