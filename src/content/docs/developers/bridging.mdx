## Builder Bridges

The Builder platform provides access to deposit‑only native bridges, as documented in the [bridging user guide](/onboarding/builder-bridging).

## Bridging Legacy Modal 
Previously, when a user attempted a contract interaction on an L2 with a zero ETH balance, a bridge modal would open. The modal could also be invoked via the query parameter `?bridge=true`, e.g., `https://nouns.build/explore?bridge=true`.

It used native bridge contracts for depositing ETH to Zora / OP / Base and was deposit‑only. Withdrawals were not supported in the modal and must be performed via the respective bridge UIs linked in the [user guide](/onboarding/builder-bridging). Bridging support remains, but the modal has been deprecated.

:::caution

The modal functionality for bridging was deprecated. Historical code can be referenced in this [release tag](https://github.com/BuilderOSS/nouns-builder/releases/tag/buildeross-v0.1.2).
